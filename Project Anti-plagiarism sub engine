Project Anti-plagiarism sub engine

anti-plagiarism sub-engine to be made for jump start, but then grow it to be a world wide service for all things written language. Pictures and videos can also be included, but if pictures, video, music and words, research and anything else then break up each category as a sub-sub engine. within the project of anti-plagiarism in a pyramid diagram. 


Likewise a separate sub engine is needed to be built to provide a service for copywriting. 
Likewise a separate sub engine is needed to be built to provide a service for trademark.
Likewise a separate sub engine is needed to be built to provide a service for  research papers.
Likewise a separate sub engine is needed to be built to provide a service for patients.
Likewise a separate sub engine is needed to be built to provide a service for code
Likewise a separate sub engine is needed to be built to provide a service for web-crawlers that is intentional and/ auto plagiarize. This has a watch list and a blank list and a gray list. How I define  a gray list is a watch list of suspects suspected of wrongdoing, watching them on the gray list until the condition of wrongdoing can be confirmed with evidence. They are watched by automate systems and robots, and a neuralnet honed for this task, no high level ai. because I refuse. 


Any other type of plagiarism then makes an explicit sub-engine for. WHY? Because I want modernized modular  smaller mutli-paridagm code bases. 


This has an api and an api gateway. 
Project Internet 2.0 ready networking ready.
Cloud ready, 
cloud datacenter minded,
Distributed architecture first design

Zero code design and architecture preplanning from the ground up
Built from scratch is preferred.
