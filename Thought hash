I spent the past 6 years creating a game engine, and I've been shocked at the things that can make or break performance.

I put together 4 simple optimisations that you can use to make your games run much quicker.

3d printer software to scale multiple warehouses in multiple locations in every country in the world. use Internet 2.0 and Internet 2.0 network, also make a subset network like a vlan to network isolate this major feature of a 3D printer and it's traffic and data packets from any potention danger 
and any dangerous individuals or group at scale. 

in the software The software knows how to spread out the workload for a large print, liken it to kubernetes.
