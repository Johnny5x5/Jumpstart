#tidelift One of the reasons to build everything from the ground up is that it is mine, and 2, I build it, so I know what is in there or I outsource building the code and 3 I do not want to be in code dependency hell.  Jumpstart in part was created and passed off to another for many reasons. I now face the core business and improved community by what tied lift does to them, get jump start to then can work on the serve sets, and tide lift can work on maintenance of software and the community, while I then can build. Tidelift is an important pillar that removing them would do harm at this early in the  ultimate goals and prime directives and prime objectives and manifestos. Furthermore such a critical entity is in place as to offload my own projects as a payload to get serviced that without tidelift "it" would crumble.




# https://tidelift.com/ i think this or something else was one of my ideas and they were successful. Investigate to see if this company should be part of my pool of my offerings within my ecosystem of services and/or products in my project(s). this idea baby looks all gone up and they look very mature at face value!! :)
