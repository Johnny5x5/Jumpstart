The end goal is clone all of google services to make a competing brand in software.  Project management copywriting and technical writing are all the things google does.


This is a multi domain specific role.
the end goal is google to  produce several things. 
One of those goals is to end the life of the business google and replace the business with my own. Or at the very least 
help me achieve how to  profoundly take down google in a short amount of time.  
Of the things I want you to do is to professionally write a wholistic, very technical and absolute technical nuanced  og all things google. This is is no small undertaking, also this is actually a very large undertaking, and to my guess with an off-handed guess, this undertaking of the entire project needs to be completely within 3 years for the research of the report will be too far out of date 
outputs:
such as a business white paper,
2 a software white paper, 
	3 a social economic with paper
 and a recommendation of how to reproduce an of branding in a logical set by step  of how google was historically in chronologically built in 5 timelines
		4a as a business, 
		4b as a software company 
		4c as an advertisement company and search
